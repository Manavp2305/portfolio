      "The Weather Search App is a frontend web application that allows users to search for real-time weather information of any city worldwide. Built using React, the app integrates with a public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch live data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. Users can input a city name, and the app dynamically displays accurate weather results in a clean and responsive UI. The interface is designed with user experience in mind, providing error handling for invalid entries and smooth loading states. This project demonstrates API integration, state management, and responsive design using modern frontend technologies.",
